I designed and developed Dubbledecker to help simplify my manic weekday commute. An easy and fast way to find out travel data was important to me as we Londoners try to optimise our time as best we can. Building Dubbledecker was my way of learning iOS development and working with RESTful web services.

Since it's launch, Dubbledecker has been featured numerous times across Apple's UK App Store. Notable categories include Best New Apps, Best Travel Apps, For Your Commute & Get Around London.
