[Random](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/random-generate-random-hex/id1046225555?mt=8 "Random on the App Store"){:target="_blank"}  is a small, useful tool to help designers find new colours for their future projects.

When working on a new project, I've always found it hard to create a palette for that product or service. The main difficulty for me is defining the primary colour and accent colours. 

Random is designed to be used casually to find an interesting colour that could be used on a current or future project.

Later down the road  I hope to add UI palette generation and shade adjustment to give it a more rounded feature set.

Random was designed in Sketch and built in Swift.
