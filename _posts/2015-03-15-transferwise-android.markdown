Redesigning the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transferwise.android "Download TransferWise from the Play Store"){:target="_blank"} was the first piece of the [TransferWise](http://transferwise.com/kish "TransferWise's Website"){:target="_blank"} product I worked on. 

Taking ownership of the end-to-end experience for the platform gave me insights into the many unique edge cases of the TransferWise product. There are many journeys a customer can take, making this the perfect on-boarding exercise for a designer.

## The Goal

With an increasing share of transfers being made through our mobile apps, the anticipated [1000% increase in mobile payment volumes for 2015](http://www.nfcworld.com/2015/01/14/333500/deloitte-mobile-payment-volumes-increase-1000-2015/){:target="_blank”} and an MVP offering that wasn’t harnessing the full potential of the platform - we decided to revisit the experience.

Growth of monthly new users, an uplift in end-to-end conversion and an uplift in NPS for the platform were all key performance indictors for the redesign. We aimed to improve all the above with a simpler and more streamlined end-to-end experience, a smarter and well promoted invite program and a more technically robust product.

## Process

Together with the mobile product manager and lead engineer we began by looking at NPS reports and customer feedback to gain a shared understanding of customer problems, business opportunities and available technologies from each of our different perspectives. We then proceeded to map out and refine the end-to-end experience. 

Next, began a very iterative cycle of designing, prototyping and user-testing all screens for all supported devices while still in close collaboration with the rest of the team. When it came to delivery, I worked very closely with our Android engineers to fine tune interactions and animations and QA the release.

## User Testing

As with all product work at TransferWise, tappable [Marvel](http://marvelapp.com/ "Marvel Prototyping"){:target="_blank"} prototypes and dev builds of the app were user-tested with both existing and potential customers throughout.
